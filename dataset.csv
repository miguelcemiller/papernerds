Abstract
"Genetic algorithms have been proved to be quite effective in solving certain optimization and artificial intelligence (AI) problems. They have been used in many application areas, including pattern recognition. However, the applications of genetic algorithms in pattern recognition have concentrated primarily on training neural networks for pattern recognition (Montana 1989, Whitley 1992, Kitano 1994). The research in this paper is aimed at using a genetic algorithm to perform pattern matching directly. The basic idea is to use a genetic algorithm to find the best match between nodes of the two patterns. An objective function can be defined in terms of the total difference in the magnitudes of angles between the corresponding edges of the two patterns. Experiments designed to evaluate the algorithm have shown very promising results with high accuracy in classifying the input patterns."
"COVID-19, an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in March 2020. By mid-August 2020, more than 21 million people have tested positive worldwide. Infections have been growing rapidly and tremendous efforts are being made to fight the disease. In this paper, we attempt to systematise the various COVID-19 research activities leveraging data science, where we define data science broadly to encompass the various methods and tools-including those from artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), statistics, modeling, simulation, and data visualization-that can be used to store, process, and extract insights from data. In addition to reviewing the rapidly growing body of recent research, we survey public datasets and repositories that can be used for further work to track COVID-19 spread and mitigation strategies. As part of this, we present a bibliometric analysis of the papers produced in this short span of time. Finally, building on these insights, we highlight common challenges and pitfalls observed across the surveyed works. We also created a live resource repository at https://github.com/Data-Science-and-COVID-19/Leveraging-Data-Science-To-Combat-COVID-19-A-Comprehensive-Review that we intend to keep updated with the latest resources including new papers and datasets."
"There have been many studies in which researchers have attempted to classify student attentiveness. Many of these approaches depended on a qualitative analysis and lacked any quantitative analysis. Therefore, this work is focused on bridging the gap between qualitative and quantitative approaches to classify student attentiveness. Thus, this research applies machine learning algorithms (K-means and SVM) to automatically classify students as attentive or inattentive using data from a consumer RGB-D sensor. Results of this research can be used to improve teaching strategies for instructors at all levels and can aid instructors in implementing personalized learning systems, which is a National Academy of Engineering Grand Challenge. This research applies machine learning algorithms to an educational setting. Data from these algorithms can be used by instructors to provide valuable feedback on the effectiveness of their instructional strategies and pedagogies. Instructors can use this feedback to improve their instructional strategies, and students will benefit by achieving improved learning and subject mastery. Ultimately, this will result in the students' increased ability to do work in their respective areas. Broadly, this work can help advance efforts in many areas of education and instruction. It is expected that improving instructional strategies and implementing personalized learning will help create more competent, capable, and prepared persons available for the future workforce."
"Recently, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a pandemic disease in over 200 countries, influencing billions of humans. To control the infection, identifying and separating the infected people is the most crucial step. The main diagnostic tool is the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test. Still, the sensitivity of the RT-PCR test is not high enough to effectively prevent the pandemic. The chest CT scan test provides a valuable complementary tool to the RT-PCR test, and it can identify the patients in the early-stage with high sensitivity. However, the chest CT scan test is usually time-consuming, requiring about 21.5 minutes per case. This paper develops a novel Joint Classification and Segmentation (JCS) system to perform real-time and explainable COVID- 19 chest CT diagnosis. To train our JCS system, we construct a large scale COVID- 19 Classification and Segmentation (COVID-CS) dataset, with 144,167 chest CT images of 400 COVID- 19 patients and 350 uninfected cases. 3,855 chest CT images of 200 patients are annotated with fine-grained pixel-level labels of opacifications, which are increased attenuation of the lung parenchyma. We also have annotated lesion counts, opacification areas, and locations and thus benefit various diagnosis aspects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed JCS diagnosis system is very efficient for COVID-19 classification and segmentation. It obtains an average sensitivity of 95.0% and a specificity of 93.0% on the classification test set, and 78.5% Dice score on the segmentation test set of our COVID-CS dataset. The COVID-CS dataset and code are available at https://github.com/yuhuan-wu/JCS."
